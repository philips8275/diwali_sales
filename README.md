# Diwali Sales Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes sales data during the Diwali season using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Key insights include sales trends, gender-wise spending, and age group preferences.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 11,251 entries and 15 columns, including customer demographics, product details, and purchase amounts.

## Steps and Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning**:

   - Gender-wise sales and spending.
   - Age group preferences and spending.
   - State-wise sales and top contributors.
   - Marital status impact on sales by gender.
   - Occupation-based sales analysis.

3. **Visualizations**:
   - Bar plots and count plots for categorical distributions and aggregated data insights.

## Key Findings

  - Female customers spent significantly more than male customers.
- **Age Group Analysis**:
  - The 26â€“35 age group had the highest purchases and spending.
- **State Analysis**:
